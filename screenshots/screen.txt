# PowerShell Environment Monitoring & Alerting

## Overview
This project is a PowerShell-based environment monitoring tool designed to track the availability of domain-joined systems in a Windows Active Directory lab. It performs automated connectivity checks and sends real-time email alerts when critical systems become unreachable.

The solution simulates a small enterprise environment to demonstrate proactive monitoring, automation, and basic incident alerting.
